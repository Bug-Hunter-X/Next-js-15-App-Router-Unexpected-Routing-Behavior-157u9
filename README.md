# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router related to unexpected routing behavior.  The issue manifests as pages not rendering correctly or receiving incorrect route parameters despite seemingly correct file structure and routing configuration.

## Bug Description

The primary problem is that under specific circumstances (often involving nested routes or dynamic segments), the App Router may fail to match the requested URL to the correct page component, resulting in a 404 error or incorrect content rendering. This can occur even with what appears to be valid routing setup according to the Next.js documentation.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected routing behavior by navigating to the different routes (details on routes are within the bug.js file and comments in bugSolution.js).

## Solution

A solution has been provided in `bugSolution.js` to address the particular problem presented in this example. The solution may involve adjustments to the file structure, route definitions, or the use of layout components or middleware to control routing behavior more explicitly.

## Possible causes

* **Incorrect route structure:**  The way routes are nested or the naming convention of route files might cause conflicts or misinterpretations.
* **Conflicts between routes:** Routes might overlap, leading to ambiguous matching.
* **Issues with dynamic route segments:** Dynamic segments in the URL may not be parsed correctly.
* **Missing or incorrect layout components:** Layout components play a crucial role in the App Router's rendering process.  Missing or incorrect layouts can lead to routing problems.

This repository serves as a resource to highlight this subtle bug and provide a potential solution. It is important to thoroughly examine routing configurations when encountering unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router.
